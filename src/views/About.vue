      <h1>About Ned</h1>
      <p>
        Ned is a writer from Waterford, Ireland whose work focuses primarily on poetry and spoken word.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love of poetry started as a teenager, but as Ned got deeper into adulthood he grew more distant from the art. In recent years though he has picked up the pen again, 
        turning to writing and performing to help process an increasingly challenging period of his life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Recurring topics include mental health struggles, coming to terms with late diagnosed ADHD, a failing marriage, collapse of a career and navigating the minefield of modern dating 
        all while striving to be the best parent possible in the middle of everything.
