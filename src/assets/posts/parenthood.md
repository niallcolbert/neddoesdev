# Parenthood

Being a parent is hard <br>
If you're a parent you already know that <br>
If your friends are parents then I'm sure they've told you <br>
But I want to talk about something else that's hard <br>
When being a parent is taken away <br>
When you used to be present for every moment <br>
And now you're only there on weekends 

I'm still a parent in name <br>
And on paper <br>
But it doesn't always feel like it 

When you're a parent you miss a lot of sleep <br>
There's a tiny hyper person who won't switch off <br>
Until you've read 18 books and sang 22 songs <br>
Or a little accident at 1am <br>
You've got pyjamas to wash <br>
Bedsheets to change <br>
"That's okay baby, it's only a little accident"<br>
You've got nightmares <br>
Tears to wipe away 


When you're not a parent you miss sleep <br>
Because you're worried that they miss you <br>
Or worse <br>
That they don't <br>
Because there's an empty bed in the next room <br>
And an empty space in yours <br>
And there should be a child in one of them <br>
Instead you cling onto the last teddy bear they called their favourite <br>
But hey, there are still tears to wipe 


When you're a parent you know that once bedtime is over <br>
It's another hour of cleaning up toys and spills <br>
Hiding the evidence of the youthful whirlwind <br>
Before you finally put your feet up <br>
But when you're not you don't tidy the toys <br>
Because putting them away means putting her away <br>
As if seeing a stack of blocks on the floor <br>
And a baby doll on the coffee table <br>
Might trick me into thinking she's still here 

Parents have a stressful time prepping for events <br>
Like birthdays <br>
Or Christmas <br>
Getting the excited child to finally sleep <br>
Laying the gifts without rousing the child <br>
Getting woken absurdly early <br>
To see what Santa brought <br>
But they see that glowing, smiling face <br>
They see the joy <br>
The face I'll see on Christmas morning is my own in the mirror <br>
It won't be joyful <br>
Red and puffy instead of glowing and smiling <br>
Because I can't get myself to sleep <br>
Muffing my sobs so I don't rouse the rest of the house 

Being a parent is sometimes having days  <br>
Where the only person you talk to is your child  <br>
Not being one is spending every single day  <br>
Where they are the only person you want to talk to  <br>

Goodbye used to mean a workout at the gym <br>
A trip to the coffee shop <br>
Groceries <br>
Now goodbye means it's this many days until you can see Daddy again <br>
It's I love you baby <br>
I'll miss you too
