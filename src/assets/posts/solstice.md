# Solstice

Waiting felt like an eternity <br>
Until I could drink you in <br>
One week, two weeks, three <br>
May as well have been decades
 
Our nights together <br>
Though few <br>
Felt like our private infinities <br>
Like life was on pause <br>
And it was just you and me <br>
Entangled, entranced <br>
Two souls detached from the world <br>
And attached to each other

We always woke up the next morning <br>
And went about our ways <br>
But during those nights <br>
Time stopped being real <br>
And our realities became each other

It is funny, isn't it? <br>
That looking back it all feels so quick <br>
Such a brief pocket of time <br>
June to October <br>
You were the brightest day <br>
My summer solstice <br>
But you were gone before the leaves had ceased falling <br>
I can count those months on one hand <br>
And those wonderful nights on the other <br>
What I can't count so easily are the times you reached me <br>
Made me smile, laugh, cry <br>
The times you made me feel something real

I wonder now do the trees forget their old leaves <br>
When the new ones come in spring? <br>
I don't know when my spring will come <br>
But I don't want to forget my old leaves <br>
So beautiful floating to the ground <br>
In reds, yellows, browns <br>
Floating away from me <br>
Leaving me bare and exposed, sure <br>
But the very thing that allowed me survive another year
