# [Learning Game Development]
#### Decebmer 30, 2020

About a year ago I underwent a big career change. After working for the same company for 4 and a half years I finally said my goodbyes and jumped ship. My new corporate home is a VR game development studio operating in the EdTech sector, Immersive VR Education. Immersive have VR games and experiences on Steam, Oculus, PSVR, Pico, and more in between. But I'm not there as a game developer.

Since I first hit the industry 6 years ago I've been working with web and mobile technologies, building UI interfaces and backend APIs in JS and PHP, and this job is no different except for some changes in frameworks. But being in an environment where I'm exposed to artists and animators, game developers and sound engineers, it's hard not to be curious.

For as long as I can remember I've been a fan of videogames, from vague early childhood memories of playing Pacman on a hand-me-down Atari 2600, to 10 year old me buying Tekken for the PlayStation a few days after getting one for Christmas 1997 and instantly becoming a huge fan of the luchador character, King. It was the first game I picked out myself and paid for with my own money. I've even had one false start at game development before, derailed by packing my home PC into storage for a house move and not seeing it again for months.

Since I gave in to the itch and re-downloaded Unity to my home PC, it's been great. I started small with a text-based game, a clone of the Atari classic Breakout, a basic rail shooter, and all along I've been planning out details for a 3rd person adventure game where you can play as my dog Loki. It's still in its infancy, so there's not much to show other than the short clip linked below, but the ride has been a lot of fun so far. Let's hope that we can see this little guy on virtual shelves some day.
