# [Game Dev 2]
#### May 22, 2021

So juggling work, college and side projects was more time consuming than I gave it credit for. I got to spend less time on Castles & Casters than I wanted to, but at I did get to spend some time, so it's not a total loss. There's not a lot to show so far, but what I can show is a time lapse of me building a sandbox level to develop in. The footage was recorded in March and it's been sitting on a drive ever since, but now that the semester is over I've got a little more time on my hands and couldn't think of anything better to use it on. It's all built using 3rd party assets picked up from the Unity store, sticking with a nice low poly aesthetic.
