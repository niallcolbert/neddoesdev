# An ode to the number 40 
I wasn't 2 months separated <br>
When I started a new relationship  <br>
Was it early? <br>
Sure<br>
And I will admit I was selfish with her <br>
I cared less about her <br>
And more about what she could do for me <br>
Even still we made it a solid year

This relationship wasn't with just any woman  <br>
No<br>
My new partner was big, and broad, and strong <br>
She made me feel safe and comfortable <br>
She made me feel like I was going places <br>
You see my new flame was... <br>
The expressway number 40 bus <br>
To Cork 

My little shorty forty was with me through a lot  <br>
In those early days  <br>
I just needed to escape <br>
She never judged  <br>
She just offered me a seat <br>
And took me away from my problems  <br>
She took me to first dates <br>
And 2nds, 3rds and 4ths too <br>
Don't worry, we weren't exclusive <br>
She'd often see dozens of other people <br>
While I was sitting right there 

She'd transport me to many nights out <br>
Last march she brought me to a ska show at Cyprus avenue <br>
Over the summer she got me to the airport  <br>
Sweet old red was right there when I shot my shot <br>
With 2024 Eurovision icon Bambie Thug  <br>
On bumble <br>
(It wasn't a match) 

Unfortunately as we reached the end of our first year <br>
I was running out of reasons to go to cork  <br>
And the drive to blindly run away had faded <br>
And so 40 and me started to drift <br>
Away from eachother I mean <br>
I'm sure she handles the road as well as ever 

Some days  <br>
She'd pass me as I saunter along Parnell street <br>
She'd hardly give me a second glance <br>
We were becoming strangers 

Then one cold, wet January night <br>
A fresh need to travel popped up  <br>
Not so far as Cork <br>
But I was reminded <br>
That lady 4-0 doesn't only stop at cork <br>
There are several other stops along the way 

Now I live by a rule <br>
To never get back with an ex <br>
But on that faithful January night <br>
I made an exception  <br>
And I climbed right back aboard <br>
The expressway number 40 bus  <br>
To Dungarvan
