Welcome to the first post on neddoes.dev, the site where Ned does dev. 

## Who is Ned?

Long story short, I'm Ned. I've been a software developer for a few years now, and lately I've been dipping my toes into indie game development.

The main aim of this site is for me to document my progess making games and for you to keep up with that progress. So watch this space for lots of updates to come.
