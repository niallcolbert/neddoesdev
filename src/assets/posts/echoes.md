# Echoes

Maybe we could have been something <br>
But I guess we'll never know now <br>
Because it all broke down  <br>
Halted by echoes

I tell you that you're beautiful  <br>
You tell me <br>
"I'm already in your bed <br>
You don't need to keep trying" <br>
But all I hear is her <br>
I hear <br>
"You've got an ulterior motive" or <br>
"You're only being affectionate  <br>
Because you're hiding something" 

In our non-exclusivity <br>
You were never shy about your escapades <br>
Yet you get the slightest hint  <br>
That I find someone else attractive  <br>
And you put your nose up <br>
You switch on the silence and walk away <br>
You play it off as a joke later <br>
But it started as a joke with her too <br>
And it puts me right back <br>
To the day that I left <br>
When that woman crossed my line of sight <br>
I didn't give her a second look <br>
I didn't even give her a first look <br>
But I was facing the wrong direction <br>
And now I'm the bad guy <br>
Not by my actions but by her insecurities  

I know you're not her <br>
I don't believe that you would be capable <br>
Capable of the things she's done <br>
But I didn't think that she was either <br>
She didn't trust my kindness <br>
And neither do you <br>
Like you she allowed insecurities  <br>
Shape her view of my reality <br>
And maybe I am too <br>
Maybe I'm seeing red flags <br>
Where I shouldn't  <br>
But too often I'm reminded <br>
Too often I hear the echo <br>
The echo of her voice on your tongue <br>
It's an echo I can't ignore
