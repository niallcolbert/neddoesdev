# Wrapped
It's December  <br>
That time of year we all wait for like good little consumers <br>
When our digital services package up our year of usage <br>
The corporate overlords throw us some fun stats <br>
A little reward for never owning anything anymore <br>
But I digress 

If you're like me then your number one digital statistical slideshow <br>
Is Spotify wrapped <br>
To me it evokes the feeling of slow end of year days <br>
Huddled in my old office comparing stats with the guys <br>
Hurling playful jeers if a guilty pleasure was over indulged <br>
It's posting Instagram stories tagging artists hoping they'll share it <br>
For that quick hit of validation <br>
Or secretly judging friends' questionable tastes 

I look at my numbers this year <br>
Just shy of 70,000 minutes <br>
It seems almost preposterous  <br>
A personal record by a significant margin 

But that's just a number <br>
What the number doesn't show <br>
Are the bus rides <br>
The train journeys <br>
The long walks <br>
Trying to escape from my corner of reality <br>
Trying to find somewhere new <br>
Somewhere I can feel like me again 

It doesn't show the late nights  <br>
In desperate need of some kind of companionship  <br>
Any voice that isn't the one in my own head 

I read through the artists and the songs  <br>
All of my top plays <br>
A coterie of the assaulted, the abused, the opressed <br>
The ones who survived pouring their pain into their art <br>
Now I pour over their art <br>
Hoping that focussing on their pain <br>
Might distract me from my own
