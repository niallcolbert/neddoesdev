# It's not easy 

It's not easy  <br>
Going back into the world <br>
I'd lived an entire life <br>
In that shell <br>
And to emerge <br>
Myself again  <br>
To clear the ground around me <br>
And rebuild  <br>
It's been no trivial thing <br>

It's been so long <br>
I scarcely remember <br>
Just who I am <br>
And besides <br>
The experiences <br>
The memories <br>
...the trauma <br>
Surely the me beneath <br>
Has been... reshaped  <br>
How can I return <br>
To who I was <br>
When I'm not him anymore?
